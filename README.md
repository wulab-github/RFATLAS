# RFATLAS

This package contains an executable file predicting the range of binding affinity for all TCR-pMHC complexes in our benchmark dataset. All source codes used to compile the executable file are also available. The source codes were written in FORTRAN 77, consisting of a main program and a subroutine of random forest classifier. All input parameters are included in two files. The first file provided the index of 7 coarse-grained groups for all 20 amino acids based on the k-mean clustering results. The second file stores the list of all interfacial residue pairs for all 572 entries in the dataset. The information about the type of each amino acid in each pair and which compartment it belongs to are also provided. Finally, a sample output file which records the prediction result of each entry and the calculated accuracy from the overall cross-validation is also presented. The classifier works on a Linux platform and can be freely downloaded for all academic users.
